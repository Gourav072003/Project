            Feuds
            Moose Wala had a rivalry with Karan Aujla; both have replied to each other through songs, on social media, and in live performances.[80][81] Both have also been criticised for songs promoting violence.[82] In an interview their mutual colleague Elly Mangat disclosed that the dispute between them began when Moose Wala's video targeting Aujla in his song was leaked to Aujla's management, and they threatened to attack Moose Wala. Following the incident, both started targeting each other on social media.[83][84] The rivalry was resolved temporarily until Aujla released a diss track, "Lafaafe", which Moose Wala responded to with "Warning Shots".[41] Aujla in an interview stated that he did not write the track "Lafaafe" and did not reveal anything about their rivalry, but praised Moose Wala's work.[85] After his death, Aujla paid tribute with the song "Maa".[86]
            
            Legal issues and controversies
            At the time of his death, Moose Wala was facing criminal charges for promoting gun culture and violence. Two of the charges were related to obscene scenes.[87]
            
            In May 2020, two videos featuring him went viral on social media: one showed him training to use an AK-47 with assistance from police officers,[88] and the other showed him using a personal pistol.[89] The six officers who had assisted him were suspended following the incident.[90] On 19 May, he was booked under two sections of the Arms Act.[91] The police began conducting raids to find Moose Wala, but he hid to evade arrest.[92][93][94] On 2 June, the Barnala District Court rejected a plea for anticipatory bail for Moose Wala and five accused officers.[95]
            
            On 6 June 2020, Moose Wala was fined by police in Nabha because his car windows were tinted darker than what was permissible, and he was allowed to leave despite being wanted on outstanding charges; he incorrectly told the officers that he was already out on bail.[5] In July, he joined the police investigation and was granted regular bail.[96] That month, he released a single titled "Sanju", comparing himself to actor Sanjay Dutt, who was also arrested under the Arms Act.[97] Indian sport shooter Avneet Sidhu criticised the song and called out Moose Wala for promoting gun culture.[98][99] The next day, a case was registered against him for releasing the song.[100] In an interview, Moose Wala alleged that he was being deliberately targeted by some news channels and lawyers.[26]
            
            References to Mai Bhago
            In September 2019, his song "Jatti Jeone Morh Wargi" was deemed inappropriate by Sikh leaders for using the name of Mai Bhago, a 17th-century Sikh warrior woman.[101][102] Sikh delegations and Akali Dal leaders demanded a ban on the song, subsequently lodging complaints against Moose Wala in Mansa and Bathinda.[102] Moose Wala later apologised on social media and in March 2020 appeared before the Sikh religious body Akal Takht in a hearing over the incident.[101]
            
            References to Khalistan movement
            In December 2020, Moose Wala released the single "Panjab: My Motherland" in support of the Indian farmers protest against the 2020 Indian agriculture acts, which featured clips of orthodox Sikh militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and speeches made by Khalistan supporter Bharpur Singh Balbir in the late 1980s.[103][104][105] In an interview Moose Wala said that Khalistan means a 'pure place' (Hindi: पवित्र-स्थान), like it was under the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, where people of all religions lived in harmony.[106]</p>
